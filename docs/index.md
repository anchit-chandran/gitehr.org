a decentralised and portable health record

## Databases Considered Harmful

Since I began working in health technology over ten years ago, I've constantly struggled with how we can make a health record that is interoperable and portable.

Much is already out there on health interoperability, and I have finally come to the conclusion that it's all misguided.

Traditional health ineroperability focuses on sending data from one Organisation-Centric Database to a different Organisation-Centric Database.

Looking at examples from other parts of the tech world, there are no successful examples of that approach working at scale.
