# Overview

GitEHR has been designed to solve the problems inherent to medical records and to be extensible in the future.

It aims to use low-tech solutions and be totally reliable.

Natively GitEHR is a technical standard which no clinician would actually manually use. It is a foundational technology upon which other systems can be built which will make clinical workflows easy for clinicians.
