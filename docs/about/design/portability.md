# Portability

Being portable, and thereby interoperable, isn't something that GitEHR has to work hard on, since portability is an emergent property of being totally [patient-centric](patient-centric.md).

When the files of a record are represented in a single directory on a disk, they can be shared with other caregiving organisations easily.

They can even be downloaded onto a portable storage medium (like a USB stick) and can be read, updated and used comprehensively in that state, for example if the patient goes off-grid because they are on an expedition or on a colony ship to Mars. Later, changes made can be merged back into the record.
