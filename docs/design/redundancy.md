# Redundancy

Every organisation providing care to a patient keeps a complete copy of the entire healthcare record. Health records are not large in the context of modern data management.

This means that all the organisations that a patient has allowed access to their medical record keep an up to date copy of the record.

Distributing the storage of medical records in this was makes them extremely resilient to loss, deletion, corruption, or vandalism.

## Tamper resistance

In the same way that blockchains use consensus to make sure that there is only one version of the truth, records that have been altered in only one place immediately stand out as having been altered.
